# NameIt # 

NameIt is a software tool that renames research articles in pdf files in a standardised way. 

Based on the pdf metadata and its content on the first page. 
It renames the file by author, year, title, publication, and publisher.

# Benefits of using NameIT

* Research articles are easier to find 
* Research articles are stored in a standardized way 

# TARGET USERS:  # 
* Human users - Researchers or research teams that want to store files in a standardised way. 
* Software users -  Software tools supporting the management of citations, bibliometrics, references, and literature reviews have now a tool and a standard way to "file name" research articles in PDF format

# How to use it 

* Invoke the Python script and pass the file to be renamed as a document .

* A GUI version for less tech users is forthcoming  <funding needed>.
